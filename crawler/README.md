# Crawler

This is set of nodejs scripts that crawl the Lemmy API and store the data to Redis.
They are also able to generate JSON output bundles for the frontend.

A redis instance must be running on `localhost:6379` for the crawler to store data.
There is a `node index.js --out` script to output the instances and communities to json for the frontend.


## Basic usage

### How to start crawling

1. Start redis server (`docker-compose up -d redis`)
 > Redis server config is in `lib/const.js`

2. Start crawler (`npm start`)
 > This will use pm2 to start the crawler in the background.
 > You can use `npm run logs` to monitor the crawler.

3. Put some jobs into the queue (`node index.js --init`)
 > This will put some jobs into the queue based off the lists in `lib/const.js`


### Using Docker Compose

The crawler can be run in docker-compose with the following commands.

1. Start redis server in background (`docker-compose up -d redis`)

2. Start crawler in foreground (`docker-compose up crawler --build`)
 > You can also use `docker-compose up -d crawler --build` and then use `docker-compose logs --tail 400 -f crawler` to monitor it.

If you want to configure auto-upload to s3 or anything, you need to copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and edit it.

| Action | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Crawl a single instance | `node index.js -m i instance.example.com` |
| Crawl a single instance's community list | `node index.js -m c instance.example.com` |



# Storage

Redis is used to store crawled data.

You can use `docker compose up -d` to start a local redis server.
Data is persisted to a `.data/redis` directory.

| Redis Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `attributes:*` | Tracked attribute sets _(change over time)_ |
| `community:*` | Community details |
| `deleted:*` | Deleted data _(recycle bin if something broken)_ |
| `error:*` | Exception details |
| `fediverse:*` | Fediverse data |
| `instance:*` | Instance details |
| `last_crawl:*` | Last crawl time for instances and communities |
| `magazine:*` | Magazine data _(kbin magazines)_ |
| `uptime:*` | Uptime data _(fetched from `api.fediverse.observer`)_ |

Most of the keys have sub keys for the instance `base_url` or community `base_url:community_name`.
