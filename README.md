# Lemmy Explorer (https://lemmyverse.net/)

This project provides a simple way to explore Lemmy Instances and Communities.

![List of Communities](./docs/images/communities.png)

The project consists of three modules:
1. Crawler (NodeJS, Redis)
2. Frontend (ReactJS, MUI Joy, TanStack)
3. Deploy (Amazon CDK v2)

## FAQ

**How does discovery work?**
 > It uses a [seed list of communities](https://github.com/tgxn/lemmy-explorer/blob/main/crawler/src/lib/const.js#L47) and scans the equivalent of the `/instances` federation lists, and then creates jobs to scan each of those servers.

**How long till my instance shows up?**
 > How long it takes to discover a new instance can vary depending on if you post content that's picked up by one of these servers.
 >
 > Since the crawler looks at lists of federated instances, we can't discover instances that aren't on those lists.
 >
 > Additionally, the lists are cached for 24 hours, so it can take up to 24 hours for an instance to show up after it's been discovered till it shows up.

**Can I use your data in my app/website/project?**
 > I do not own any of the data retrieved by the cralwer, it is available from public endpoints on the source instances.
 >
 > **Please don't hotlink the files on the public website, I'd prefer if you don't pull data from there directly in scripts.**
 >
 > Currently, I upload a Redis dump generated by the crawler each night to s3, GitLab builds the JSON dump from that.
 >
 > Data is available in the releases section of this repo: https://github.com/tgxn/lemmy-explorer/releases/
 >
 > `dist-json-bundle.zip` file contains the data in JSON format:

 > - `communities.full.json` - list of all communities
 > - `instances.full.json` - list of all instances
 > - `overview.json` - metadata and counts
